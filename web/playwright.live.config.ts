// Live-backend Playwright config.
//
// Live specs under `tests/live/` spawn a real `aoe serve` per test via
// `tests/helpers/aoeServe.ts`, with isolated HOME/XDG/TMPDIR/TMUX_TMPDIR
// and a worker-indexed port range. There is no global Vite preview server;
// each test gets its own backend.
//
// Use `npx playwright test --config=playwright.live.config.ts`.
//
// CI runs this from the `playwright-live` job (see .github/workflows/ci.yml)
// after building `aoe` with default features (serve included). Local runs pick up
// the binary from `AOE_E2E_BINARY` or fall back to `../target/release/aoe`.
